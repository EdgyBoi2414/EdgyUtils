# EdgyUtils

Set a utility classes for use when making spigot/bungee plugins.
Essentially a wrapper for the Plugin classes that both APIs use.

Code is updated and used as needed. This repo should not be considered maintained. Some code is taken from other open source projects.
Most utility classes work separately from each other, some will only work when used as a dependency of a real Bungee/Spigot plugin.

The project can be built into its own Bungee/Spigot combination plugin using shadowJar, or you can shadow the project into another plugin.
